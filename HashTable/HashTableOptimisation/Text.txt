"Home" is perhaps the most important thing in a person's life - "home sweet home", as they say. Yet in Britain's teenage culture, home has long been seen as a place to leave, rather than a place to live. And while the age of independence is, for many young people, becoming later and later, the desire for independence is developing at a younger and younger age. This is Sarah’s story.
 It was one evening in April that Sarah decided to leave home. It was not that she disliked her home; not even that she had a lot of arguments with her parents. As a family, everyone got on quite well together; but in the small Dorset town of Crewkerne, there wasn't exactly a lot to do. Besides, Sarah didn't actually live in Crewkerne, but in a village where there was even less to do. She was fed up with school too. Though she had done quite well in her exams, she had not chosen the right subjects for "A" level and had become disillusioned.
    Her parents liked the village life; her father, a businessman, was always travelling, and enjoyed coming back at weekends to the peace of Dorset; her mother had a part-time job in the town. Her elder brother was away at university, her 14-year old sister was, in Sarah's words, "a nuisance".
    "I just wanted to get out," says Sarah. "I felt too cooped up; and it was so boring. So, I decided to come up to London. For the time being I'm selling beads, but I'm looking for a proper job too."
    Sarah is one of the lucky ones. Her parents are giving her an allowance until she finds a job, and she lives with two other girls in a flat in Hampstead. She's artistic, she doesn't smoke or take drugs, and can talk intelligently. She'll probably get a job quite quickly.
    "I'm glad I left home," she says; "I'm 18 now, and I'm in charge of my own life. I go home quite often; but I prefer living my own life."
